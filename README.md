## 🧠 About Me

From a young age, I’ve been passionate about technology and how things work behind the screen. That curiosity naturally evolved into a strong foundation in programming—and even though I'm still young, I've already built a solid path as a **Full-Stack Developer**.

I specialize in crafting clean, scalable, and responsive applications using modern web technologies. Whether it’s building RESTful APIs, designing user-friendly interfaces, or integrating third-party tools, I take pride in delivering thoughtful solutions that work.

Besides coding, I’m deeply interested in systems, cybersecurity, and how to make applications both efficient and secure. I strongly believe in continuous learning, and I'm always open to diving into new challenges or technologies.
